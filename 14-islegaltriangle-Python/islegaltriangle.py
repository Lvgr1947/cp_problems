# islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3)
# Write the function islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3) that takes three int or float values representing
# the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns True if such a triangle exists and False
# otherwise. Note from the triangle inequality that the sum of each two sides must be greater
# than the third side, and further note that all sides of a legal triangle must be positive. Hint:
# how can you determine the longest side, and how might that help?

def islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3):
	if s1>0 and s2>0 and s3>0:
		a = [s1,s2,s3]
		b = max(a)
		a.pop(a.index(b))
		sum = 0
		for i in a:
			sum += i
		if b<=sum:
			return True
